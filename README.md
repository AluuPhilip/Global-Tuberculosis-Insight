### Project Overview 
---
The "Tuberculosis Insight" repository presents a comprehensive analysis of global Tuberculosis trends, treatment outcomes, and age-specific impacts. 
This project delves into extensive datasets  countries spaning from (2000-2019), 
aiming to provide valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of Tuberculosis. 
The analysis covers the evolution of Tuberculosis incidence and mortality rates worldwide, 
shedding light on trends, regional disparities, and age-specific patterns. 
Through visualizations created with Tableau, the repository offers a detailed analysis of how TB has evolved over the years, 
highlights regions with significant changes, and investigates the distribution of deaths across different age groups.
This comprehensive exploration aims to contribute valuable insights into the complex landscape of Tuberculosis, , 
contributing to the broader conversation on public health strategies and interventions.

### Data Source 
---
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the data source is from "Kaggle dataset"
### Tools Used 
---

- Excel - Data cleaning
- Tableau - Creating report
- SQL
- POPSQL

### Data cleaning/preparation
---

In the initial initial data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks
1. Data loading and inspection into Excel
2. Handling missing values
4. Data cleaning and formatting
5. Used Dax function for calculation
6. Changed data Type to it appropriate types, like date , country, strings and numbers
7. Loaded the Deffrent Tables into SQL
8. Used POPSQL for analysis
9. Used Power Query for Creating calculated feilds/ Columns and remove Duplicates

### Exploratory data Analysis (EDA)
---

EDA involved exploring the kaggle dataset to answer key questions such as;

Broad Question:
  
- How has the incidence of all forms of tuberculosis and related mortality changed over the years?

Targeted Analysis Questions:

- What is the overall trend in the incidence of all forms of tuberculosis worldwide?

- Are there specific countries or regions that have seen a significant increase or decrease in tuberculosis incidence?

- How has the distribution of tuberculosis-related deaths across different age groups evolved over the years?

Broad Question:

- What is the treatment success rate for different forms of tuberculosis?

Targeted Analysis Questions:

- What is the treatment success rate for new TB cases globally, and how has it changed over time?

- How has the treatment success rate for XDR-TB cases evolved over the years?

Broad Question: 

- Are there significant regional disparities in the incidence, mortality, and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis?

- Targeted Analysis Questions:

- Which regions or countries have the highest incidence of all forms of tuberculosis?

Broad Question:

- How effective is the case detection process, and what are the trends in reporting all forms of tuberculosis?

Targeted Analysis Questions:

- What is the global case detection rate for all forms of tuberculosis, and how has it changed over the years?

- How does the reported incidence of tuberculosis compare with estimated incidence, and are there regions where underreporting or overreporting is prevalent?

### Findings 
---
1. Reported motarlity due to Tuberculosis(2000-2019) is 56,580,596 persons
2. There was 30% decrease of motarlity due to Tuberculosis from 2000 to 2019
3. Eswantini had the highest reported  estimated incidence of Tuberculosis of 21,357 cases followed by south Africa 20,673 then Lesotho with 19756 cases
4. While India had the highest Motarlity of 9,701,599 persons followed by Indonesia with 1,994,642 deaths then Pakistian with 1,494,237 deaths
5. The Average detection rate of tuberculosis increased from 74.3% from 2000 to 2019
6. Tuberculosis are more prevalant with Persons within the the age of 15- 49 years while the least prevalnt was people with the 5-14 years age brackect 
7. There was under reporting of the cases of tuberculosis 
   
### Recommendation 
---
- Based on the Tuberculosis Analysis findings, here are some recommendations:

1. Strengthen TB Control Measures: Despite reduced mortality, TB remains a health concern. Governments should invest in early detection, treatment, and prevention.

2. Target High-Burden Countries: Focus efforts on countries with high TB rates like Eswatini, South Africa, India, and Indonesia.

3. Improve Reporting Systems: Enhance data collection to accurately track TB cases and allocate resources effectively.

4. Focus on High-Risk Groups: Prioritize testing and treatment for individuals aged 15-49, where TB is most prevalent.

5. Promote Collaboration: Encourage partnerships between governments, healthcare providers, and NGOs to share resources and expertise.

6. Invest in Research: Support research on drug-resistant TB, vaccines, and new treatments to improve outcomes.

By following these recommendations, we can work towards reducing the burden of TB globally.
